# AWS CLI Resource Reporter 🚀

This is a beginner-friendly shell script that uses the AWS CLI to report current AWS resource usage from your configured account. It retrieves a list of:

- 🗂️ S3 Buckets  
- 🖥️ EC2 Instances  
- ⚙️ Lambda Functions  
- 👤 IAM Users  

## 📌 Why this project?

As part of my DevOps learning journey, I created this script to understand how to interact with AWS services programmatically. It demonstrates:

- Installing and configuring AWS CLI on a Linux system (like EC2)
- Using CLI commands to query AWS services
- Writing and executing Bash scripts
- A practical first step into cloud automation and infrastructure monitoring

## 🛠️ Requirements

- AWS CLI v2 installed
- AWS credentials configured via aws configure
- Linux environment (EC2, WSL, Ubuntu, etc.)
